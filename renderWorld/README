This is a benchmark from Intel that renders a MineCraft-like world
procedurally.

The .html file loads renderWorld.js.

The current version of renderWorld.js is tuned for good performance
using data structures that interact well with PJS; the parallel
version executes at almost 2x the frame rate over the sequential
version on an AMD quad-core, and at more than 2x the frame rate over
the sequential version on an Intel quad-core with HyperThreading.

renderWorld-rgbobj.js is an intermediate state, it parallelizes well
but the amount of storage allocated by the kernel and tenured into the
general heap is large.  Though it is much faster than the original,
the parallel version trails the sequential version by a good bit
(26fps vs 33fps).

renderWorld-orig.js is the original program, it does not parallelize
well at the moment either because the PJS engine does not handle its
data structure (2D array, looks like) or because our handling of the
cursors is not fast - TBD.

Hot path for root tracing hits shouldMoveObject().

shouldMoveObject() calls isInsideFromspace(cell) and
getForwardedPointer().  The latter is always-inline and optimized,
probably can't do better.  The former will be the bottleneck, so
may be worth worrying about that predicate.

For moveToTospace(), there is a lot going on.

- getObjectAllocKind is complicated and not inline
- allocateInTospace calls allocate() which is not inline
- moveObjectToTospace is complicated, not inline, 
  duplicates some test from getObjectAllocKind, and has
  several callees that are not inline even though
  they will often short-circuit.

A profile with "Instruments" shows about 140ms in sync() for a
single-threaded run, ie, about 10% of the compilation time.


------------------------------------------------------------

Baseline with new register alloc is slower (timings generally in the 1120 range).  Why is this?

 - Register set management is actually slow?
 - Too much sync() because:
    - not properly optimized?
    - common register conflicts, eg, join-reg == return-reg, or join-reg too early in the register set
 - Something unexpected?
 - Profile hints at a lot of malloc overhead (labels, vectors) but I don't really trust the profile

Need *good* profiling data.

 - Can we just instantiate AngryBots in the shell to get rid of firefox crud?
 - Any better on Linux?

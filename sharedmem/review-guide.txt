TODO:

- need to have specific asks from the reviewers

- Want feedback on
  - specification formalism
  - appropriateness
  - naming, etc
  - correctness of merging into TA, esp
  - the open issues

Reviewers

Formal, at large:

- filip

Formal, memory model:
- waldemar

Formal, agents:

What can be done in Feb/March?

- integration with ES:
  - new SAB type
  - modifications to TA
  - new Atomics object
  - note the spec draft issues that all point to issues in the tracker, these are usually open design issues,
    need feedback on these too
  - list specific sections of section 7 that are NOT ready for review: 7.2.1
  - note 7.3.5, 7.3.6, 7.3.7 might be replaced but could use the review anyhow
  - section 8 need probably not be reviewed at this time

- agent design is *ongoing*, but the substance is fixed

- futexes vs synchronics is *ongoing*, but the substance is fixed

I'm hoping I can get a first round of reviews of this proposal
underway and completed well before the March TC39 meeting.  The
reviewers are listed by area below, if you're summoned above you're on
my list.

What is NOT YET ready for review are:

- the memory model (section 7.2.1), I need one more week the agent
- model, because it has moved to its own spec, see link at the top of
  the spec text

What may be PREMATURE to review is:

- futexes (sections 7.3.5 through 7.3.7), because there's a refinement
  going on, see link at the top of the spec text, though feedback is welcome
- Web/HTML integration (section 8), because that's getting some 
  separate attention from HTML people

There are two broad areas of feedback I'm looking for:

- correctness, notation, naming, and overall fit with ES6, notably for
  TypedArray and SharedArrayBuffer, but really in general
- open design issues, all linked from the spec text, search for "(Issue nn)"

Obviously all feedback is welcome, even if it does not fit those areas.


Formal reviewers at large:

- Dan Ehrenberg, Google
- Brian Terlson (or a delegate), Microsoft
- Filip Pizlo, Apple

Formal reviwer for the memory model:

- Waldemar Horwat, Google

Formal reviwer for the agents subspec:

- Domenic Denicola, Google (though he's helping with the design too)

Informal/volunteer reviwers of the overall API and ES integration issues:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock
- Mark Miller, Google

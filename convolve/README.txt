Many variations on a simple convolver benchmark, using both PJS and
Web workers.  Also some PJS garbage collection tests based on that
benchmark.

All must be run from a directory containing the input file "cat.pgm".

In test mode, the programs output a hex dump that must be run through
the "unhex" program to produce the output pgm file; the pgm can be
viewed directly in Emacs.

The cat picture "cat.pgm" is a free photo of an Amur leopard taken
from morguefile.com on 27 May 2014, URL http://mrg.bz/MT0rPL.  It has
been scaled down significantly, cropped slightly, and converted from
jpeg to pgm.

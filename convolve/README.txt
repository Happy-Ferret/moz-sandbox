Many variations on a simple convolver benchmark, using both PJS and
Web workers.  Also some PJS garbage collection tests based on that
benchmark.

All must be run from a directory containing the input file "cat.pgm".

In test mode, the programs output a hex dump that must be run through
the "unhex" program to produce the output pgm file; the pgm can be
viewed directly in Emacs.

This directory contains a polyfill for a data-parallel primitive
called Multicore.build(), as well as many samples for how to use it
and some test code.

The file <a href="notes.txt">notes.txt</a> contains a discussion of
what motivates this new primitive and what sets it apart from the
existing PJS primitives such as Array.prototype.mapPar().

The file <a href="Multicore.js">Multicore.js</a> is the polyfill for
the new primitive.

The file <a href="samples.js">samples.js</a> contains many examples of
how it can be used.

\centerline{\bf Abstract}

\vskip 0.5in
I have undertaken a software implementation of the Data Encryption
Standard (DES), my main purpose being the attainment of as high an
encryption rate as I could manage.  A number of optimizations of the DES
algorithm have been implemented, resulting in a C program that is able
to encrypt or decrypt 8.2 megabit per second on one of the College's DEC
Alpha workstations.
